# What is $BITZ?

- It is the first ePOW commodity token that anyone can mine on Eclipse

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have a Eclipse wallet set up and funded with ETH on Eclipse
Have a computer with terminal access

# Setup Steps
Note: For Windows OS you must first download WSL (https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

**Note: When prompted chooose option 1 and then run this:**
    
    source $HOME/.cargo/env

### 2. Install Solana CLI:
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://solana-install.solana.workers.dev | bash
     
**Note: After successful inststall, add Solana to your PATH (the installer will provide instructions for this) or optionally restart your termial.**

### 3. Create a local keypair/Wallet
    solana-keygen new

**This will create a new keypair and store it in the default location (~/.config/solana/id.json).**
**Take note of your public key and phrase (displayed after generation).**

### 4. Set the rpc to Eclipse mainnet:
    solana config set --url https://bitz-000.eclipserpc.xyz/

**You can view your address by running:**   

    solana address

**You can view your balance by running:**
